# ML-Student_Performance
 This project aims to recreate and improve the performance of best model from a [research paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61d468d5254730bbecf822c6b60d7d6595d9889c) [1] on predicting student performance. The original study utilized several machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines for Binary Classifications, Five-level Classifications, and Regression. In this implementation, I focused on the Regression model utilizing the Portuguese dataset and enhanced it with the use of XGBoost, achieving better accuracy with a lower RMSE score.
